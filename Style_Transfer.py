Neural Style Transfer with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks:

Weâ€™ll *recreate* a style transfer method that is outlined in the paper,
[Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks, by Gatys]
(https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)
in PyTorch. This is one of the first method to do style transfer. 

In this paper, style transfer uses the features found in the 19-layer VGG Network,
which is comprised of a series of convolutional and pooling layers,
and a few fully-connected layers.
The convolutional layers are named by stack and their order in the stack.
Conv_1_1 is the first convolutional layer that an image is passed through, in the first stack.
Conv_2_1 is the first convolutional layer in the second stack.The deepest convolutional layer in the network is conv_5_4.

**Note: This is a general code you can change the model, weights and the selected layers

    These feature maps are used to calculate the losses.

    `layers` is a dictionary that maps between the index of a given layer and its name.
    Here we will use the layers that are mentioned in the paper.
    Then we feedforward the image through the layers.
    We store the feature maps of every layer in `layers` dictionary in a new dictionary `features`.
    Then we return this dictionary.

    Then we will determine the number of steps (how many iterations we update the target image).

    4- Calculate the content loss.
    which is defined as the mean square difference between the target and content features at layer `conv4_2`.

    5- Calculate the style loss. We iterate through each style layer.

    After that, we calculate the Gram matrix for the target features.
    The style loss for one layer is the mean square difference between the Gram matrices.
